cd ~/ros2_ws
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Build the workspace**
```bash
colcon build
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Source the setup file**

### **2.2. Running the Project**

#### **2.2.1. Launch the Full Navigation Stack**
Run the following command to start Gazebo, map server, planner, smoother, trajectory generator, controller, and RViz:
```bash
ros2 launch my_turtlebot bringup.launch.py
```

#### **2.2.2. Set Pose Estimate in RViz2**
Once RViz2 opens, click **‚Äú2D Pose Estimate‚Äù** and place the robot‚Äôs approximate position on the map.  
This allows AMCL to localize the robot properly.

#### **2.2.3. Send a Test Goal Pose**
After setting the pose estimate, you can give a goal pose via terminal using the command below (example):
```bash
ros2 topic pub /goal_pose geometry_msgs/PoseStamped "header:
  frame_id: 'map'
pose:
  position: {x: 1.5, y: 0.5, z: 0.0}
  orientation: {z: 0.0, w: 1.0}" -1
```

## **8. Design Choices, Algorithms, and Architectural Decisions**

### **8.1. Design Overview**
The project follows a **modular ROS 2 architecture** with each core functionality implemented as an independent node.  
This promotes scalability, debugging ease, and reusability.

### **8.2. Algorithms Used**
- **A\*** for **global path planning** to generate a raw global path to the desired goal.  
- **Savitzky‚ÄìGolay filter** for **path smoothing**, to ensure continuous and physically feasible trajectories.  
- **Constant-velocity time parameterization** to convert spatial paths into time-aware trajectories.  
- **PD Controller** for motion control, ensuring responsive and stable robot movement.

### **8.3. Architectural Decisions**
- Each processing stage (planner ‚Üí smoother ‚Üí trajectory ‚Üí controller) is modular and communicates through ROS 2 topics.  
- Parameters such as velocity, window size, and PD gains are configurable via launch files.  
- Real-time visualization in RViz2 enables clear understanding of robot state and trajectory.

## **9. Extension to a Real Robot**

To adapt this project to a **physical TurtleBot or custom robot**, the following steps can be added:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Replace simulated sensors with **real sensor topics** (e.g., `/scan` from LiDAR, `/odom` from encoders).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Update TF tree for the physical robot frames (`base_link`, `odom`, `map`).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Integrate with actual **motor drivers** using the `/cmd_vel` topic.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Calibrate PD gains (`Kp`, `Kd`) for the physical system‚Äôs inertia and wheelbase.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Validate using **SLAM Toolbox** or **Cartographer** for real-time map creation and localization.

## **11. Extending to Avoid Obstacles and Improve Navigation**

The current system assumes a static environment and uses a simplified pipeline (**A\*** ‚Üí Smoother ‚Üí Trajectory ‚Üí PD Controller).  
To extend this project for **dynamic obstacle avoidance** and **advanced navigation**, the following improvements can be implemented:

### **11.1. Integrate the Full Nav2 Stack**
Use the complete **Navigation2 (Nav2)** architecture instead of standalone nodes.  
Nav2 provides an ecosystem of planners, controllers, costmaps, and recovery behaviors for handling dynamic environments.

### **11.2. Use Advanced Global Planners**
Replace the simple A* node with more sophisticated planners such as:  
- **Smac Planner (2D Hybrid-A\*)** ‚Äì produces smoother, kinodynamically feasible paths.  
- **Smac Lattice Planner** ‚Äì uses motion primitives matching the robot‚Äôs kinematics.

### **11.3. Adopt Advanced Controllers**
Replace the PD controller with modern, model-based controllers like:  
- **MPPI (Model Predictive Path Integral)** Controller ‚Äì performs sampling-based optimization for dynamic, smooth control.  
- **TEB (Timed Elastic Band)** Controller ‚Äì optimizes timing and trajectory spacing in real-time.

### **11.4. Enable Dynamic Costmaps**
Activate **Nav2 costmap layers** for real-time obstacle representation using sensor data (LiDAR or depth camera).  
- **Obstacle Layer** ‚Äì dynamic obstacle mapping  
- **Inflation Layer** ‚Äì maintains safe margins  
- **Voxel Layer** ‚Äì enables 3D environment awareness

### **11.5. Integrate Behavior Trees**
Implement **Nav2 Behavior Trees (BTs)** for high-level decision-making, recovery behaviors, and autonomous task management.

---

‚úÖ By combining **Smac Lattice planning**, **MPPI control**, and **Nav2 costmap + BT integration**, this system can evolve into a **fully autonomous, real-time navigation framework** capable of safe and adaptive operation in **dynamic real-world environments**.
