# ü¶æ ROS 2 Navigation Assignment ‚Äì Path Planning, Smoothing & Control

This repository contains all ROS 2 packages developed for the **Autonomous Navigation Assignment**.  
The packages together implement a complete navigation pipeline ‚Äî from path planning to smooth trajectory execution ‚Äî for a differential-drive robot such as **TurtleBot3**.

## üì¶ Repository Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my_turtlebot/          # Launch files, URDF, and robot bring-up
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ path_planner/          # Generates global paths between start & goal
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ path_smoother/         # Applies Savitzky‚ÄìGolay filter to smooth the path
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ trajectory_generator/  # Converts smoothed path into timed velocity commands
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ robot_controller/      # Sends velocity commands to move the robot
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build Instructions

> Make sure you are inside your workspace (e.g., `~/10x_ws`).

```bash
cd ~/10x_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

To verify:
```bash
ros2 pkg list | grep planner
ros2 pkg list | grep smoother
```

## üöÄ How to Launch

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Bring up the robot (URDF + base nodes)
```bash
ros2 launch my_turtlebot bringup.launch.py
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start full navigation pipeline
```bash
ros2 launch trajectory_generator pipeline.launch.py
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Send a goal pose
```bash
ros2 topic pub /goal_pose geometry_msgs/PoseStamped "header:
  frame_id: 'map'
pose:
  position: {x: 2.0, y: 1.0, z: 0.0}
  orientation: {z: 0.0, w: 1.0}" -1
```

## üß© Package Summary

| Package | Node | Function |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **path_planner** | `planner_node` | Generates raw global path |
| **path_smoother** | `smoother_node` | Smooths the path using Savitzky‚ÄìGolay filter |
| **trajectory_generator** | `traj_node` | Generates smooth time-based velocity profiles |
| **robot_controller** | `controller_node` | Controls the differential-drive motion |
| **my_turtlebot** | Launch files | Integrates all nodes with robot description |

## üß† Key Concepts Demonstrated

- ROS 2 node communication (topics, parameters)
- Path planning & smoothing
- Differential-drive motion control
- Launch file orchestration
- Modular package design

## üß™ Results

- Raw vs. smoothed path visualized in **RViz2**
- Robot follows smoothed trajectories with minimal oscillation  
- End-to-end autonomous motion successfully achieved
