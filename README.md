## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Launch the Full Navigation Stack
Run the following command to start Gazebo, map server, planner, smoother, trajectory generator, controller, and RViz:
```bash
ros2 launch my_turtlebot bringup.launch.py
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Pose Estimate in RViz2
Once RViz2 opens, click **‚Äú2D Pose Estimate‚Äù** and place the robot‚Äôs approximate position on the map.  
This allows AMCL to localize the robot properly.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Send a Test Goal Pose
After setting the pose estimate,you can give goal pose via terminal using below code(example):
```bash
ros2 topic pub /goal_pose geometry_msgs/PoseStamped "header:
  frame_id: 'map'
pose:
  position: {x: 1.5, y: 0.5, z: 0.0}
  orientation: {z: 0.0, w: 1.0}" -1
```

### Design Choices, Algorithms, and Architectural Decisions**

#### üß© **Design Overview**
The project follows a **modular ROS 2 architecture** with each core functionality implemented as an independent node. This promotes scalability, debugging ease, and reusability.

#### üß† **Algorithms Used**
- **A\*** for **global path planning** to generate a raw global path to desired goal.
- **Savitzky‚ÄìGolay filter** for **path smoothing**, to ensure continuous and physically feasible trajectories.
- **Constant-velocity time parameterization** to convert spatial paths into time-aware trajectories.
- **PD Controller** for motion control, ensuring responsive and stable robot movement.

#### üß± **Architectural Decisions**
- **ROS 2 Nodes and Topics:** Each processing stage (planner ‚Üí smoother ‚Üí trajectory ‚Üí controller) is a separate node communicating through defined topics.
- **Parameterization:** All major parameters (e.g., speed, window size, Kp/Kd gains) are configurable via ROS 2 parameters.
- **Visualization:** RViz2 integration enables real-time visualization of path, smoothed trajectory, and robot motion.

### **2.3. Extension to a Real Robot**

To adapt this project to a **physical TurtleBot or custom robot**, the following steps can be added:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Replace simulated sensors with **real sensor topics** (e.g., `/scan` from LiDAR, `/odom` from encoders).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Update TF tree for the physical robot frames (`base_link`, `odom`, `map`).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Integrate with actual **motor drivers** using the `/cmd_vel` topic.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Calibrate PD gains (`Kp`, `Kd`) for the physical system‚Äôs inertia and wheelbase.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Validate using real-world mapping tools like **SLAM Toolbox** or **Cartographer** to generate maps dynamically.

### **2.5. Extending to Avoid Obstacles and Improve Navigation**

The current system assumes a static environment and uses a simplified pipeline (A* planner ‚Üí Smoother ‚Üí Trajectory ‚Üí PD Controller).  
To extend this project for **dynamic obstacle avoidance** and **advanced navigation**, the following improvements can be implemented:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Integrate the Full Nav2 Stack:**  
   Utilize the complete **Navigation2 (Nav2)** architecture instead of standalone nodes.  
   Nav2 provides an ecosystem of planners, controllers, costmaps, and recovery behaviors that handle real-world dynamic environments seamlessly.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Use Advanced Global Planners:**  
   Replace the simple A* node with sophisticated planners such as:  
   - **Smac Planner (2D Hybrid-A\*)** ‚Äì produces smoother, kinodynamically feasible paths.  
   - **Smac Lattice Planner** ‚Äì uses motion primitives that align with the robot‚Äôs kinematic constraints, ideal for differential and car-like robots.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Adopt Advanced Controllers:**  
   Replace the PD controller with model-based controllers like:  
   - **MPPI (Model Predictive Path Integral)** Controller ‚Äì performs sampling-based optimization to compute smooth, dynamically-feasible velocity commands.  
   - **TEB (Timed Elastic Band)** Controller ‚Äì optimizes trajectory timing and spacing in real time.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Enable Dynamic Costmaps:**  
   Activate **Nav2 costmap layers** to represent moving and newly detected obstacles using sensor data (LiDAR / depth camera).  
   - **Obstacle Layer** for dynamic obstacle mapping  
   - **Inflation Layer** to maintain safety margins  
   - **Voxel Layer** for 3D awareness in complex spaces

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Integrate Behavior Trees:**  
   Employ **Nav2 behavior trees (BTs)** for decision-making, recovery, and task orchestration.  
   BTs provide a modular, reactive control structure that can handle obstacle encounters, replanning, and recovery autonomously.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Incorporate AI-Based Prediction (Optional):**  
   Extend the perception stack with **machine-learning models** to predict obstacle motion and assist local planners in proactively adjusting paths.

---

‚úÖ By combining **Smac Lattice planning**, **MPPI control**, and **Nav2 costmap + BT integration**, the system can evolve into a **fully autonomous, real-time navigation framework** capable of safe and adaptive operation in **dynamic real-world environments**.
